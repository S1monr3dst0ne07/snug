        <pre style="font-size: 150%">
            The parsing and emittance of expressions is handled by the "expr" namespace.
            It implements a standard recursive-descent grammar and does not respect operator presidents.
            Emitting such an expression, using the "generate" generic, will obligate the implementation
            to, at runtime, put the result of it's evaluation into the "acc" register.

            The callers of "expr.generate" are obligated to interface with this in a meaningful manner.
            By doing so, the number of redundantly emitted and later optimized out instructions
            can be reduced and the resulting binary be made more humanly readable.
