        <h1>The Heap</h1>
        <p>
            The heap is managed by the VM and located in the upper half of memory, above the stack. <br>
            It is composed of so called 'blocks', which contain the size of the block along the actual data. <br>
            Ergo, when allocating N words, the block containing these words, will have the size N+1. <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Block Format</h2>
        <p>The following is a diagram of the heap block format:</p>
        <pre>
    +------+--------------+-------+       +------+--------------+-------+
... | Size | ... Data ... | After |  ...  | Size | ... Data ... | After | ...
    +------+--------------+---^---+       +------+--------------+---^---+
       |                      |              |                      |
       \----------------------/              \----------------------/
