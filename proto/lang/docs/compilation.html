        <h1>Compilation</h1>
        <pre>
            Compilation is broken down into multiple passes,
            as is common compiler etiquette.
            Lexing is done via a state-machine tokenizer.
            Grammar is done by a recursive-descent parser.
        </pre>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Concepts</h2>

        <div>
            <h3>Objs</h3>
            <pre>
            Objs (short for Objects),
            are semantic features, which the compiler treats as units.
            They share common interfaces. See <a href="objs.html">Objs Doc</a>.
            </pre>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Trees</h3>
            <pre>
            Tree (unlike in git),
            are scope containers and bundle together objs, which share a namespace,
            as well as other scoped members, such as (scope native) global constants.
            A module is a tree, a routines is tree, a program is a tree.
            </pre>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Root Tree</h3>
            <pre>
            The root tree is the tree, that contains all of the substance to be compiled.
            Usually that is the full program, with all imports expanded.
            </pre>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h2>Passes</h2>

        <div>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <pre>
            The preparation is the most complicated pass
            and is divided into phases, that may be run recursively.
            The aim of this pass is to prepare the root tree.
        </pre>

        <div>
            <h4>Lexing</h4>
            <pre>
            The lexing phase takes a path to a source file,
            reads it into memory, then tokenizes it.
            It constructs a streamer, which will deliver the tokens to the parser.
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Parsing</h4>
            <pre>
            Parsing reads the stream and invokes the matching parse inferfaces,
            per recognized object. During this process, the trees are built up,
            merely as skeletons, containing only leaf data.
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Constant Rendering</h4>
            <pre>
            Global and scope local constants are rendered for all trees.
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Expansion</h4>
            <pre>
            Imported modules are resolved and are recursively prepared.
            They are merged into the tree from which they are referenced.
            </pre>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h3>Generation</h3>
        <pre>
            In this pass, the actual conversion to the execution layer happens.
            Again, this pass is complicated as has multiple phases.
        </pre>
        <div>
            <h4>Collection</h4>
            <pre>
            This phase runs in the root tree,
            where all the dependencies of the main routines are collected and recursively generated.
            This is done to ensure that the super routines can link correctly with the sub routines.
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Binding</h4>
            <pre>
            This is where the routines bind to their parameter interfaces.
            Variables are injected, for the parameters, into the variable mapper of the local compilation context.
            They are defined by the offsets from the base pointer and are computed by order.
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Inference</h4>
            <pre>
            Here, variable are inferred from the expressions present in routines.
            This is done by invoking the "infer" interface on objs.
            Obviously, this step must come after the binding phase.
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Scope construction</h4>
            <pre>
            Space on the stack is reserved for the local variables.
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Branch generation</h4>
            <pre>
            The branches of the tree are generated in sequence.
            The is done by invoking the "generate" interface on objs.
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Scope deconstruction</h4>
            <pre>
            Space on the stack is collapsed where the local variables are.
            </pre>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Optimization</h3>
            <pre style="color: gray;">Compiler not mature for optimizations yet.</pre>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Assembly</h3>
            <pre>
                The generated Ir has it's definitions and references resolved.
                A call-hook for the main routine is prepended to the executable.
            </pre>
        </div>
