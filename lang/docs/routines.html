        <p>Routines are like c-functions, predefined paramters & stack management</p>

        <h2>Parameter Interface</h2>
        <p>
            Passing call parameter to a routines is done by the caller-routines allocating so called paramater space in it's own scope.
            The callee then indexes into this parameter space negatively relative to it's own base pointer.
            The in-parameter come before the out-parameters.
        </p>

        <pre>
-----------------+----------+-----------+-------------+---------------+-----------------
... Caller-Scope | In-Param | Out-Param | Call-Header | Callee-Locals | Callee-Scope ...
-----------------+----------+-----------+-------------+---------------+-----------------
        </pre>

        <p>
            The call-header contains return address and caller base pointer.
            Its is managed by the VM.
