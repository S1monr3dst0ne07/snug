        <p>
            As per conventions (and silicon) the bootloader is put into memory at address 0x7c00 by the bios.
            The bootloader sets up it's own stack (mind: stack grows down), living at 0x7000 under the itself.
            The kernel is loaded at 0x9000, well above the loader.
            The kernel stack is placed at 0x8000, which will override the bootloader image and it's stack,
            but this is fine, because by then it will be inactive.
